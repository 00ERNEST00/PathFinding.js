	<title>JSDoc: Class: This class SHOULD NOT be directly instantiated, as it does not provide 
any path-finding algorithms or methods and is intended to be extended 
by all the other path-finder classes.

Note: The constructor does NOT receive any arguments for instantiation.
    All the parameters should be passed in in the `init` method.
    Therefore, you only need to instantiate this class once, and call
    the `init` method each time you start a new path-finding.</title>
